# Logic Gates

- A chip designed to deliver a well-defined functionality
  - Elementary (Nand, And,...)
  - Composite (Mux, Adder)

## NAND

- elementary gate
- x NAND y => if x and y are both 1 then 0 else 1

### Gate Interface / Gate Implementation

- *Gate Interface*: gate abstraction
  - what the gate is supposed to do
  - unique (one unique was to describe what the gate is supposed to do)
- *Gate Implementation*:
  - how the chips works
  - may have multiple implementations

### Circuit Implementation

- AND gates represented by connection between switches in series
- OR gates in parallel representation
